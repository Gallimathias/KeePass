# KeePass - Fork

Welcome to this git reposetory. Here you find my fork to KeePass. On the one hand I add some small features which are interesting for me and on the other hand I try to fix some lecks.

Over time the fork could deviate more and more from the original.

## motives

One of the reasons why I started with the fork is to be found on CLattenzaun.de another one is based in the plugin HttpPlugin and because I find KeePass great. I also find it more convenient for people to work on KeePass via GitHub than sending emails to Dominik Reichl via SourceForge.

Also, it has to be said that on Github the code is more visible than on SourceForge. At least that's my opinion.

## Brief explanation on branching:

In general I use Git Flow therefore

* productive = my published version of the fork, at the moment a fork of the origin code. see reichl branch
* reichl = the unchanged code officially published by Dominik Reichl
* stable = my current development branch
